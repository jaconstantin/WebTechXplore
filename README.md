Study and Xplorations on the basics of Web Dev Technologies

This repository stores my studiess and explorations on the basics of web development technologies. It deals with basic syntax and how-to's that can be used as quick reference and templates for future advance projects. 

As of now there are only two directories in this archive. One is exploring the use of Javascript in adding interactive content to a web page. The other deals with samples scripts for using MySQL. I plan on using these learnings as building blocks for my upcoming web based Expense Tracker application.
